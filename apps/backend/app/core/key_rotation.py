"""JWT signing key rotation with hot reload.

The M3 hardening milestone implements OAuth-style "kid" rotation:

- ``settings.secret_key`` is the **current** signing key (new tokens).
- ``settings.previous_secret_keys`` is an ordered list of **previous**
  keys (newest first) that are still trusted for **verification only**.
  Tokens minted before the rotation are still accepted until they
  expire or until the operator removes them from this list.
- During rotation the operator sets ``SCHOLARHUB_SECRET_KEY`` to the
  new value and ``SCHOLARHUB_PREVIOUS_SECRET_KEYS`` to the comma-
  separated list of old keys (newest first). New tokens use the new
  key; old tokens verify against the legacy list until they expire.
- Once all pre-rotation tokens have aged out, the operator clears
  ``previous_secret_keys`` and the list drops back to empty.

Hot reload: ``reload_settings()`` clears the ``get_settings`` LRU
cache so the next call returns a fresh ``Settings`` instance. The
runtime calls ``reload_settings()`` at startup and on a SIGHUP-equivalent
admin endpoint (``POST /api/admin/security/reload``). Note that rotating
the signing key without restarting is a deliberate trade-off: it lets
operators respond to a suspected key compromise without downtime,
but it relies on ``Settings`` being re-read on every hot path. The
``_active_secret_keys()`` helper below re-reads settings every call,
so it always sees the latest values; nothing in the request path
caches the key list.

Defence in depth: hot reload is gated to admin callers, and the
admin endpoint itself does not require the legacy key. If the
operator loses ALL keys, the only recovery is a process restart
with the new env vars, which is intentional.
