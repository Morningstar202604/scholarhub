"""Data-retention constants and helpers.

Values match the public privacy policy so the policy and the code
cannot drift apart silently. Operators run the cleanup jobs from
their scheduler of choice; we expose ``retention_cutoff`` so a
caller can compute the bound without hard-coding the policy in
multiple places.

Retention policy (mirrors ``/api/privacy``):

- Account PII: held until the user requests deletion; soft-deleted
  accounts are anonymised in place and hard-deleted after
  ``USER_DELETION_GRACE_DAYS`` days.
- Audit logs: ``AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`` days.
- Backups: 90 days (operational concern, not enforced in code).
