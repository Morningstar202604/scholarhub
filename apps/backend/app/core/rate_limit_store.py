"""Rate limiter store abstraction (M4 hardening).

The middleware in ``app.middleware.rate_limit`` delegates bucket
storage to a ``RateLimiterStore``. Two implementations are shipped:

- ``MemoryRateLimiterStore``: in-process sliding window. Default
  when ``SCHOLARHUB_REDIS_URL`` is empty. Fine for single-node
  deployments; loses state on restart; not safe across replicas.
- ``RedisRateLimiterStore``: uses Redis sorted sets with a fixed
  time window, atomic via Lua. Falls back to the memory store when
  Redis is unreachable so a Redis outage never denies legitimate
  traffic (fail-open for the limiter, fail-closed for the bucket —
  i.e. if Redis is down the limiter behaves as it did before M4).

The store protocol is intentionally tiny — just ``hit_and_check``
returning whether the request is allowed and the current bucket
depth. Tests in ``test_rate_limit_store.py`` cover both backends.

Why Redis instead of in-memory as the recommended default: most
production deployments run at least two replicas behind a load
balancer, and per-IP limits that count only on the local replica
are effectively halved (or worse) compared to the configured limit.
Redis is the cheapest way to keep the limit global.

    Algorithm: for every hit we ZADD a unique member into a sorted

    then ZREMRANGEBYSCORE to drop entries older than the window,
    ZCARD to read the current depth, and PEXPIRE to refresh the

    run inside a single Lua script so the bucket depth seen by
    concurrent callers is consistent.

    Failure mode: if the Redis call raises, we log a warning and
    fall back to an ``allow=True`` result (i.e. **fail-open**).
    Rationale: the rate limiter is a defence-in-depth control; if
    Redis is down we would rather let traffic through and risk a
    brief burst than 503 the entire API. The strict-path limits
    (login, register, etc.) remain in the memory fallback so an
