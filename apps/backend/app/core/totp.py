"""TOTP (RFC 6238) helpers for the M2 hardening milestone.

Why hand-roll: the well-known ``pyotp`` library is on the deny list
because it transitively pulls in ``cryptography`` already required by
our ``Fernet`` usage, and ``pyotp`` adds no security value we cannot
provide in ~80 lines. The RFC is small and the failure modes are
predictable when we own the code.

Design choices:

- Secrets are 20 bytes (160 bits) of CSPRNG output, encoded as
  base32 with no padding. RFC 4226 recommends 160 bits (section 4
  "Recommended parameters") and we follow that exactly.
- The HOTP counter is the number of 30-second windows since the
  Unix epoch (``time.time() // 30``). Replay protection comes from
  tracking the last successfully-verified counter in the user
  record (so a code within the current or previous window is
  accepted at most once).
- Constant-time comparison via ``hmac.compare_digest`` so timing
  side channels cannot leak which digit was wrong.
- Drift tolerance: we accept the previous window (T-1) when the
  current window fails, which covers clock skew up to 30s. We do
  NOT accept T+1 because a stolen code from a slightly-future
  client clock should not be usable.

Encryption-at-rest: the cleartext secret is encrypted with Fernet
before being persisted to ``User.totp_secret_encrypted``. The
encryption/decryption boundary lives here, not in the route, so
every code path that touches the secret is funneled through one
place.
