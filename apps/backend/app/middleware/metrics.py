"""HTTP request metrics middleware (pure ASGI).

Records ``scholarhub_http_requests_total`` +
``scholarhub_http_request_duration_seconds`` for every request, with the
**template path** (e.g. ``/api/users/{user_id}``) as the label so cardinality
stays bounded even under load.

Why a pure ASGI middleware instead of ``BaseHTTPMiddleware``?

- ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` wraps the downstream ASGI app in its own
  ``__call__``. The ``request.scope`` it receives is *pre-routing*, so
  ``scope["route"]`` is not set and we cannot read the FastAPI route
  template from inside ``dispatch``. This middleware, being a single
  ASGI app in the chain, sees the **post-routing** scope where
  ``scope["route"]`` is populated by FastAPI's router.
- Cardinality is bounded: HTTP path is the **template**, never the
  raw URL. Status is bucketed to 1xx..5xx. No per-tenant or per-user
  labels (those go to the structured logs).
