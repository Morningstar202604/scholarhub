"""Discipline ontology access + validation helpers.

The catalog stores ``discipline`` and ``subdiscipline`` as strings on
each ``Resource`` row. These helpers check whether a given string
maps to an entry in the ``disciplines`` / ``subdisciplines`` tables
for the current tenant, and (when the discipline is set) whether the
subdiscipline actually belongs to that discipline.

Used by the catalog create / update endpoints so we reject obviously
wrong taxonomy input at the boundary instead of letting bad strings
silently land in the DB.
