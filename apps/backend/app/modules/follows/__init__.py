"""Follows module — author follow + discipline subscription.

Implements the ``author_follows`` + ``discipline_subscriptions`` flow
in a module-shaped home.

Design choices:

- Tenant-scoped (``tenant_id`` + RLS).
- Author follows key on the author NAME (string), not a separate
  ``authors`` table. The catalog module's design comment explicitly
  defers the structured ``Author`` (ORCID/affiliation) table to a
  future phase; the primary author storage on main is the JSON
  ``authors`` list[str] column on ``resources``. Following a string
  name matches that model and avoids forcing a cross-module FK to a
  table that does not exist yet.
- No rate limiting of its own; the shared RateLimitMiddleware
  covers these endpoints.
- Scope: follow / subscribe + listings only. Fanning a *new resource*
  out to followers is not implemented — submissions notify the editor
  and reviewers (``notifications.services.create``), not followers.
  If follower fan-out is wanted later it belongs in the approval path,
  not this module.
