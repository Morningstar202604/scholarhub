"""Library module — member-curated reading lists.

A reading list is a named, ordered collection of catalog resources
owned by a user. Items are added (idempotent) and removed (idempotent).
Lists are private to their owner; ``is_public`` is intentionally not
implemented (YAGNI — add when a sharing feature actually lands).

Depends on the catalog module (Resource FK).
