"""Submission module — author → editor → catalog workflow.

Implements the ``resource_submissions`` flow in a module-shaped home,
with these deliberate design choices:

- Tenant-scoped (``tenant_id`` + RLS).
- ``resource_id`` is an integer FK to ``catalog.resources.id``; the
  catalog module uses int PKs everywhere.
- The approval path always creates a catalog ``Resource`` from the
  submission payload (``_materialize_resource_from_submission`` builds
  the ORM object and commits it in the same transaction as the status
  change — it does not go through an HTTP call to the catalog module).
- Notifications ARE wired: assignment / decision handlers call
  ``notifications.services.create()`` in the same transaction. Follower
  fan-out (notifying the *author's* followers) is not implemented.
