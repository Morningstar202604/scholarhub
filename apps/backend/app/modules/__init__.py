"""Enabled modules — the explicit registry.

To enable a module, add its package name (under ``app.modules.<name>``)
to ``ENABLED_MODULES``. The startup ``load_all()`` imports each name in
order; each module's ``__init__.py`` constructs a ``ModuleManifest`` and
calls ``registry.register(...)``.

Why explicit list (not entry-point scanning):

- Zero third-party dependency, debuggable, no surprises at startup.
- scholarhub does not run a plugin marketplace (see ARCHITECTURE.md
  "What we chose not to do"); vendored modules are all we need.
- Adding/removing a module is one line in one file.
