"""Content-based recommendation engine.

Builds a user interest profile from reading history (tags + disciplines
+ subdisciplines of read resources) and scores unread catalog resources
by tag overlap + discipline / subdiscipline matches. Falls back to the
latest catalog resources when the user has no reading history yet.

Scoring weights sum to 1.0 so the score stays in [0, 1]:

- tag overlap:    0.6  (precision: overlap / candidate tag count)
- discipline:     0.3  (1.0 if the candidate's discipline is in the profile)
- subdiscipline:  0.1  (1.0 if the candidate's subdiscipline is in the profile)

Cross-module reads: imports ``Resource`` (catalog) and ``ReadingHistory``
(reader) models only — no routes or schemas — per the module boundary
rules in ARCHITECTURE.md. All queries are scoped by ``tenant_id`` so
recommendations never leak across tenants (defense-in-depth with RLS).
