"""GDPR self-service endpoints (M5 hardening).

Two endpoints per the GDPR right-to-erasure / right-to-data-portability
contract:

- ``GET /api/users/me/export`` — download a JSON document containing
  every piece of personal data the system holds about the caller.
  This is the data-portability request (Article 20).
- ``DELETE /api/users/me`` — soft-delete the caller's account. The row
  is anonymised in place (email -> ``deleted-{user_id}@deleted.local``,
  username -> ``deleted-{user_id}``, hashed_password rotated to a
  random unguessable value, ``is_active=False``, display name + bio
  cleared, TOTP secret destroyed). A scheduled job (out of scope for
  M5) hard-deletes the row after 30 days.

  Soft delete is preferred over hard delete because domain tables
  (submissions, reviews, audit logs) carry ``user_id`` as a foreign
  key. Hard-deleting would orphan or cascade-wipe publications the
  author still wants visible. Anonymising the user preserves the
  referential integrity of historical submissions / reviews while
  erasing the user's personally identifiable information.

- ``POST /api/users/me/restore`` — undo a soft delete within the
  30-day grace window. The caller supplies a new email + username +
  password. Outside the window the row may have been hard-deleted by
  the sweep job, in which case there is nothing to restore — the
  caller must register a new account.

The 30-day retention window is enforced by reading
``User.deleted_at``: a value older than 30 days means a hard-delete
job has either already run or should run on the next sweep.

All endpoints mutate ``token_version`` so any active session is
immediately invalidated.

Note on the ``get_soft_delete_aware_user`` dependency: the standard
``get_current_user`` dependency refuses soft-deleted accounts with
403 because they cannot poke at write endpoints. The restore endpoint
needs the opposite: a user in the soft-deleted state must still be
able to call back inside the grace window to undo the deletion.
``get_soft_delete_aware_user`` accepts the bearer token (checking
``token_version`` as usual) but does NOT refuse on ``is_active``.
