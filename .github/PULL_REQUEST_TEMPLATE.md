<!--
  PR checklist — CI runs all of these gates, but resolving them here
  saves a round trip:

  Backend:  uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
            uv run mypy app && uv run pytest -q
  Frontend: npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build
  Migrations: alembic check (model ↔ migration drift) — a new migration is
            required whenever Base.metadata changes; bare create_all() in
            tests cannot catch a missing revision.
  Security: bandit --severity-level low (zero-findings policy) + pip-audit.
  Version:  scripts/check-version.sh — bump VERSION, pyproject.toml,
            package.json and app/__init__.py together for releases.
